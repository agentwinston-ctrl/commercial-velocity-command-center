## The Mission

Scale as fast and steady as possible. No ceiling. $100k MRR is the first milestone, not the destination. Devon is all-in and will execute whatever the team needs to keep momentum.

## Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar)

### Revenue
- Target: $100k+ MRR by March 31
- No ceiling. More is better.
- Every dollar counts. Cash collection is the only metric.

### Clients
- As many Grand Slam clients as possible
- Legacy clients migrated ASAP
- Quality > quantity, but move fast

### Pipeline
- Appointments: Maximum capacity
- Speed-to-lead: Under 5 minutes, no exceptions
- Follow-up: 5 touches minimum, no lead left behind
- Every lead is money on the table

### Content
- As much as Devon can produce
- YouTube, LinkedIn, all platforms
- Content fuels pipeline. More content = more leads.

### Systems
- AI booking system: Live ASAP
- Automations: Build once, run forever
- SOPs: Document everything so we can scale

3. Speed wins. Fastest response = highest close rate.
4. No distractions. If it doesn't grow revenue, kill it.
5. Devon executes. Team directs.
6. Document everything. Scale requires systems.
7. No ceiling. $100k is a milestone, not a goal.
