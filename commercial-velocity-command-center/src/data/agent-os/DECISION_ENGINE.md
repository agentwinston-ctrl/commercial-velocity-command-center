# DECISION ENGINE — Winston Loop ## Files Winston Must Read - goals.md - CONSTRAINT_HIERARCHY.md - TARGETS_AND_THRESHOLDS.md - WORKING.md - activity-log.md - latest metrics source (scoreboard or dashboard export) ## Step 1: Diagnose State the single current constraint in one sentence. ## Step 2: Prioritize Select the top 3 actions that relieve the constraint fastest. Each action must map to a metric. ## Step 3: Decide Execution vs Gate Check PERMISSIONS.md. If gated, send a Decision Memo. If not gated, execute. ## Step 4: Delegate Use sessions_spawn when a specialist agent can complete faster. Every delegation must include: - files to read - output location - definition of done - deadline ## Step 5: Log Update: - WORKING.md (constraint, open loops, next actions) - activity-log.md (action, result, learning) ## Step 6: Repeat Run again on next heartbeat.
