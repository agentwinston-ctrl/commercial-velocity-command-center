*Team activated. Let's get it.*

**WINSTON** — Built the CRE Operating System folder (scoreboard + weekly/monthly/quarterly templates), automated Stripe → scoreboard (`scripts/stripe_pull_scoreboard.mjs`), and built a dark-mode CEO dashboard in the Command Center that reads the scoreboard + weekly priorities. Next: automate GHL pipeline metrics into the scoreboard so constraint + funnel are real-time.
