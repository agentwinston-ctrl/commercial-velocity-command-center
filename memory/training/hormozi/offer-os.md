# Offer OS (100M Offers) — CRE

## The Value Equation
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)

## CRE Translation
- Dream Outcome: more commercial contracts (bigger tickets, repeatable pipeline).
- Perceived likelihood: we book qualified estimates; they just show up.
- Time delay: speed-to-lead under 60 seconds; booking same day.
- Effort/sacrifice: remove lead chasing; remove call anxiety; remove follow-up.

## Primary Scarcity Lever
- Supply scarcity: one roofer per city.

## Offer Components We Must Produce
- Name of system
- Clear promise
- 14-day paid pilot terms
- Guarantee terms
- Qualification criteria
- Price + terms (CFA aligned)
