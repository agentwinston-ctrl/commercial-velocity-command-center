# OPERATING PHILOSOPHY — Tradeoff Rules When tradeoffs exist, prioritize in this order: 1. Protect the business (legal, survival, catastrophic risk) 2. Stabilize retention and increase LTV 3. Grow profitable MRR 4. Increase speed and founder leverage 5. Improve systems and elegance Never sacrifice a higher priority for a lower one. Examples: - Do not scale acquisition if churn is unstable. - Do not improve dashboards while sales conversion is broken. - Do not chase new channels until current channel output is predictable.
