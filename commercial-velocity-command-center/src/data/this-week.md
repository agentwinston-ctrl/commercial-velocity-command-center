# This Week — Top 3 Priorities

Week of: 2026-02-04 (through 2026-02-15)

1) Lead flow + bookings: daily outreach + follow-ups inside the sponsored commercial roofing FB group.
2) Run the bi-weekly webinar consistently (same cadence, same execution) to convert engagement into booked calls.
3) Launch a simple lead magnet: free marketing audit (audit ads/marketing, build plan, convert on audit call).

## One thing to attack today
Post in the FB group + DM follow-ups to voters/commenters. Book calls.

## Notes
Keep execution tight. Don’t over-rotate on model changes. Retainer stays alongside performance while we compare.
