Current constraint: Constraint confidence is limited because acquisition-chain metrics are not wired (GHL pending). Stripe-only retention logic is currently simplified per Devon and may distort historical churn if pause_collection is treated as churn.

Today’s top 3 priorities:
1. Keep weekly scoreboard update stable and validated (cron runs Mon 5am PT).
2. Monday Weekly Focus Brief now enters Meeting Mode to set weekly priorities with Devon confirmation.
3. When ready, spec and wire GHL acquisition metrics to unlock full constraint detection.

Active experiments:
-

Pending decisions (waiting on Devon):
-

Open loops:
- Weekly priorities in goals.md remain blank until next Monday meeting.

Notes:
- Weekly Focus Brief cron updated to include Meeting Mode steps.
