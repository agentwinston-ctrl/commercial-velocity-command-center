# CRE — “Hammer Them” Retargeting SOP (Adapted from Jeremy Haynes)

Source doc: "Hammer Them Ad Strategy SOP" (Jeremy Haynes)

Last updated: 2026-02-04

## Purpose
Increase:
- show rate
- connection rate
- conversion rate

By **pre-framing** leads in the 72 hours before the call with high-frequency, hyper-relevant content.

In CRE terms: make prospects feel like they already know you, trust you, and understand the next step before the appointment.

## When to use
- You are generating leads (ads/SEO/outbound to landing page)
- You have booked calls on a calendar
- Show rate or close rate is below target

If you don’t have consistent lead flow yet, this is phase 2. For the current blitz, we can still use the same concept with organic + email/SMS “hammer content.”

## Why it works (psychology)
1) Familiarity bias + mere exposure effect
2) Sell the **next step** (show up to call), not the whole offer
3) Objection handling happens before the call
4) Expectations get set so the call is efficient

## CRE content pillars (what to publish)
All content = short vertical videos (Reels style). No copyrighted music so it can be used in ads.

Pillar 1: Questions (first-layer)
- “How do you get qualified commercial estimate opportunities?”
- “What’s the process from lead → booked estimate?”
- “What’s required from the contractor to win?”

Pillar 2: Second-layer questions
- “What does ‘qualified’ mean exactly?” (sq ft, job type, service area)
- “How do you prevent tire-kickers?”
- “How do you route leads if you serve multiple counties?”

Pillar 3: Objections
- “I’ve tried leads before and they sucked.”
- “We don’t have time to follow up.”
- “How do I know you’re not selling my leads to 5 guys?”

Pillar 4: Expectations
- “What results look like in 14 days.”
- “What happens week 1 vs week 2.”
- “If you don’t answer the phone, nobody can help you.”

## The 72-hour hammer (delivery)
Target: 15–20+ touches in 72 hours prior to call.

### Paid version (Meta retargeting)
- Audience: all leads who opted in or booked
- Objective: engagement/video views (depends on account)
- Serve: a sequence of the above content

### No-ads version (what Devon can do now)
- Confirmation page includes 3–5 breakout videos
- Email/SMS sequences drip 3–5 “hammer” pieces (links)
- Manual DM: drop 1 proof asset + 1 expectation asset

## Minimum asset pack to execute in CRE
1) Main confirmation video (2–4 min)
2) 6 short reels (2 per pillar for a start)
3) 1 proof PDF (calendar screenshots + 1-page how we work)
4) 1 expectations piece (what happens in 14 days)

## GHL implementation notes
- Tag: `booked_call`
- Workflow: booked → send confirmation page → send hammer content links at T+2h, T+24h, T-2h
- Track: show rate per segment (source + geography)

## KPI targets
- Show rate: 70%+
- Connection rate: 50%+ reply/confirm within 24h
- Close rate improves as a byproduct when show rate rises

## Next actions for CRE
1) Create the 6 reels (script them first)
2) Add 3 breakout videos to confirmation page
3) Add hammer content links to the Booked sequence in GHL
