# Commercial Rev Engine — Calendar Protection Policy (Qualified Definition)

Purpose: protect the roofer’s calendar, protect the relationship, and prevent “surprise billing” disputes.

## Qualified Commercial Estimate = must meet all of the below
1) **Commercial-only** (no residential)
2) **Inside agreed service geography** (statewide only if client meets statewide requirements)
3) **Decision-maker path**: property owner, facility manager, property manager, GC (if they control roofer selection), or a direct/confirmed path to the decision-maker
4) **Job intent**: inspection, maintenance, repair, replacement, or a bid/spec request with clear next step
5) **Contactability**: valid phone + ability to confirm appointment

## Size guidance
- We prioritize **10,000+ sq ft** when square footage is known.
- If square footage is **unknown**, we do not auto-disqualify. We qualify by property type + intent and collect size info during the qualification call.

## Enterprise tier rule
- **Enterprise** = **100,000+ sq ft** (when known during qualification)
- Booking fee: **$1,000** per booked Enterprise estimate
- Otherwise **Standard** booking fee: **$500** per booked qualified estimate

## What is NOT qualified
- Residential inquiries
- Outside service geography
- No clear decision-maker path
- “Just shopping” with no next step, no timeline, and no willingness to schedule

## Appointment confirmation standard
To count as booked, the appointment must have:
- Calendar invite sent
- Lead confirmation message (SMS/email) sent
- Reschedule path provided

## Predictability (anti-churn)
We provide a weekly “tab update”:
- Leads
- Qualified
- Booked
- Month-to-date booking fees
- Option to cap volume (10 / 20 / custom)

## Statewide exclusivity requirements (must meet all)
1) Coverage across the state (2+ crews or equivalent install partners)
2) Sales capacity (dedicated sales rep or owner sells full time)
3) Scheduling capacity (can run estimates within 7 business days across the state OR define hub regions)
4) Commercial acceptance (repairs/replacements/maintenance/inspections)
5) Proof of reality (top 5 regions served + current monthly capacity)
