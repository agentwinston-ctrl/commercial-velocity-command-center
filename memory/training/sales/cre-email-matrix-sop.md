# CRE — Email + SMS Matrix SOP (Adapted from Jeremy Haynes)

Source doc: "The Email Matrix SOP - Get More Revenue From Email" (Jeremy Haynes)

Last updated: 2026-02-04

## Purpose
Use email + SMS to:
- increase response rate
- increase show rate
- convert "curious" into booked calls
- reduce ghosting

For CRE, email is not a newsletter. It is **pipeline insurance**.

## Core principle
**Context = more money.** Segment your list so every message feels 1:1.

### Minimum segmentation fields to collect (every form)
- Service area (metros/counties)
- Role (owner/GM/estimator)
- What they want (more inspections/estimates per month)
- Job type focus (commercial only vs mixed)
- Capacity (can you run X estimates/month?)

If you only collect name/email/phone, you’re choosing low open rates.

## CRE segmentation map (simple)
Segment leads into 4 buckets:
1) **Booked** (appointment set)
2) **Engaged unbooked** (DMs/texts replied, no time booked yet)
3) **Unresponsive** (no reply yet)
4) **Past no-show / rescheduled**

Then sub-segment by:
- Geography (state/metro)
- Company size (Standard vs Enterprise)
- Channel (FB group, outbound CRM, SEO/ads)

## The matrix (what we send, when)
### A) Appointment show-up sequence (Booked)
Goal: show rate 70%+
- T+0: SMS confirmation + link to confirmation page
- T+5m: email “What we’ll cover + how to prepare”
- 24h before: SMS confirm/reschedule
- 2h before: SMS confirm
- 15m before: “I’m here, see you soon”

Content assets to link:
- 2 to 4 min confirmation video
- 3 short Q&A modules (qualification rules, timeline, expectations)
- 1 proof asset (calendar screenshot or case study)

### B) Convert-engaged sequence (Engaged unbooked)
Goal: move to a booked time fast
- Day 0: “Two times that work?”
- Day 1: proof drop + single question
- Day 2: “close the loop” message (yes/no)

Email subjects that work:
- “quick question about {city}”
- “{company} — should I close this?”
- “re: commercial estimates in {metro}”

### C) Reactivation sequence (Unresponsive)
Goal: get any response so a human can close
- Day 0: different angle (not the same pitch)
- Day 1: short selfie-style video (or text that feels human)
- Day 3: proof PDF or screenshot + “worth a chat?”
- Day 5: “I’ll stop bugging you” close-the-loop

### D) No-show rescue sequence (Past no-show)
Goal: reschedule and salvage
- Immediately after no-show: “All good. Want to reschedule? A or B?”
- 2h later: “Still want this solved or should I close your file?”
- Next day: single proof asset + reschedule link

## Message rules (non-negotiable)
- One point per message
- One CTA only (reply YES, pick A/B, or book a time)
- Don’t teach in email. Teach on the call.
- Use names, cities, and their stated goal in the first line

## What to build in GHL
1) Tags/fields for the segmentation above
2) 4 workflows (Booked, Engaged, Unresponsive, No-show)
3) Template library:
- 10 SMS templates
- 10 short emails (plain text, no marketing fluff)
4) Proof asset pack (1 PDF, 1 calendar screenshot set)

## KPI targets
- Email open: 40%+ on segmented sequences
- Reply rate: 15%+ on engaged/unresponsive sequences
- Show rate: 70%+

## Next action
Pick 1 lead source first (FB group or CRM outbound) and implement sequences A + B. Those move cash fastest.
