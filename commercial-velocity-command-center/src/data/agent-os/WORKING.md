No urgent blockers spotted on heartbeat.

Notes:
- goals.md weekly priorities section is still blank. Needs Devon + RADAR update so the team can align daily actions.
- Latest activity-log update was 2026-02-13: Stripe → scoreboard snapshot (week of 2026-02-09): $1,666 collected last 7d, $21,723.42 last 30d, $80,585 MRR, 22.9% churn (30d), 37 active clients.
- Next obvious execution thread: automate GHL pipeline metrics into the scoreboard for real-time constraint tracking.
