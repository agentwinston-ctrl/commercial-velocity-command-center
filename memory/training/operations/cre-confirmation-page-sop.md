# CRE — Confirmation Page SOP (Adapted from Jeremy Haynes)

Source doc: "Confirmation Page Best Practices SOP" (Jeremy Haynes)

Last updated: 2026-02-04

## Goal
Increase show rate, reduce ghosting, and shorten the sales cycle by controlling prospect due diligence and framing.

For CRE, the confirmation page is not a receipt. It is a **show-up + pre-sell engine**.

## The 3 outcomes we want
1) Prospect confirms the appointment and saves it to calendar
2) Prospect consumes proof + mechanism so the call starts “pre-sold”
3) Prospect arrives with fewer objections (trust, price, risk, timeline)

## Page structure (top to bottom)
### 1) Hard confirmation
- Big headline: “You’re booked” + date/time + timezone
- Button: “Add to Calendar” (Google/ICS)
- Clear instruction: “If you can’t make it, reschedule here”

### 2) What happens next (reduce uncertainty)
- 3 bullets only:
  - We’ll text you to confirm
  - Be ready to answer X questions (service area, commercial focus, capacity)
  - If you’re driving/in a job, reschedule now

### 3) Main confirmation video (2–4 minutes)
Purpose: gratitude + authority + rules.
Script outline:
- “Glad you booked. This call is to see if we can book qualified commercial estimates onto your calendar.”
- “This isn’t generic marketing. We sell booked commercial estimates.”
- “To respect both our time, here’s what makes you a fit…” (commercial focus, capacity, decision maker)
- “If you’re not serious, reschedule or cancel now.”

### 4) Breakout videos (optional, 60–120 seconds each)
Use 3 to 5 max. Each addresses one due-diligence question.
Recommended modules for CRE:
- “How we define qualified (Calendar Protection Policy)”
- “What the 14-day proof pilot is and what it isn’t”
- “Why speed-to-lead + follow-up is the whole game”
- “What you need on your side to win (sales + capacity)”
- “Pricing explained (pilot → deposit credit → per booked estimate) or retainer option”

### 5) Proof stack (trust assets)
- Calendar screenshot (booked estimates)
- 2 to 3 short testimonials (specific outcomes)
- “How we work” one-pager link
- Business legitimacy: company name, contact, simple footer

### 6) Pre-call micro-commitment
- 1 question form (reduces no-shows):
  - “What’s your service area (metros/counties)?”
  - OR “How many commercial estimates do you want per month?”

### 7) Follow-up synergy (must match page)
- SMS after booking: confirm + link back to confirmation page
- 24h + 2h reminders (confirm + reschedule)
- “Hammer content” = re-send the breakout video links

## CRE-specific rules
- Keep it short. Every extra element is drop-off.
- Confirmation page must align with the offer we sell: booked commercial estimates, not ads.
- One CTA: show up/reschedule. Not multiple funnels.

## KPI targets
- Show rate target: 70%+
- Reschedule rate (healthy): 10–20% (better than no-show)
- No-show rate: under 20%

## Implementation notes (GHL)
- Use a dedicated confirmation page per funnel.
- Trigger: appointment booked → redirect to confirmation page + send confirmation SMS/email.
- Store: watched video? (optional), answered micro-question.

## Next build items
- Write the main confirmation video script (CRE-specific)
- Create 3 breakout video scripts
- Build the GHL confirmation page template + automation
