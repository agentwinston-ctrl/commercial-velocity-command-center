# Execution OS — CRE

## Diagnose Before Prescribe
Always identify the constraint:
1) Leads (volume)
2) Booking % (conversion from lead to booked)
3) Show-up rate

## Anti-Agency Rule
We sell infrastructure. If we drift into selling ads/hours, stop.

## Default Weekly Cadence
- Monday: pipeline + outreach targets
- Daily: Rule of 100
- Friday: bottleneck review + fix one thing
