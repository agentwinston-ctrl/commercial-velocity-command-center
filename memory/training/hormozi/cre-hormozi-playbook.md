# Hormozi Playbook for Commercial Rev Engine (CRE)

Purpose: turn Hormozi into on-demand guidance for *our* offer: we sell booked commercial roofing estimates (not ads), using a managed acquisition + follow-up + qualification + booking system.

Last updated: 2026-02-04

## 1) North Star: Grand Slam Offer fit
Hormozi’s core is simple: your offer wins when the prospect believes the **value** is huge relative to the **price**, and it’s easy to say yes.

Value is driven by 4 levers:
1. **Dream outcome** (what they really want)
2. **Likelihood of achievement** (believability + proof + risk reversal)
3. **Time delay** (how fast they get meaningful results)
4. **Effort & sacrifice** (how much work and pain they personally have to do)

CRE translation:
- Dream outcome: “more revenue from commercial jobs” becomes “more *qualified* commercial estimates on your calendar.”
- Likelihood: guarantee, proof, process, qualification rules, and speed-to-lead.
- Time: 14-day pilot, fast booking.
- Effort: we run ads + follow-up + qualification + booking. They just show up and sell.

## 2) Our offer (current) framed in Hormozi language
### Offer name
Commercial Roofing Velocity System.

### What we sell
Booked, qualified commercial roof estimates on their calendar.

### Risk reversal
14-day paid pilot: they fund $1,500 ad spend, we work for free. If we don’t book 3 qualified commercial estimates, they don’t pay the $8,000 setup.

### Pricing model (Money Models)
Customer Financed Acquisition:
- Post-pilot: $8,000 setup + $500 per booked estimate.

Hormozi alignment notes:
- Keep the promise extremely specific: “calendar invites” not “leads.”
- Keep the guarantee tied to the *first meaningful win* (booked estimates), not a fuzzy KPI.

## 3) What to tighten to increase perceived value (without changing delivery)
These are the highest leverage “offer upgrades” that don’t require new capabilities.

1) **Define ‘qualified’ like a contract.**
   - Commercial-only.
   - Decision maker or direct path to decision.
   - Service area.
   - Basic project qualifiers.

2) **Make the first 14 days feel inevitable.**
   - Day 0 to 2: setup + tracking + calendar sync.
   - Day 3 to 7: leads + speed-to-lead + first bookings.
   - Day 8 to 14: stabilize booking rate + show rate.

3) **Stack proof.**
   - Screenshots of booked calendars.
   - Call recordings.
   - Before/after metrics: lead to booked rate, show rate.

4) **Reduce effort.**
   - “We plug into your calendar, we handle follow-up, we confirm, we reschedule no-shows.”

## 4) Lead acquisition principles (100M Leads) applied to CRE
Hormozi’s model: pick channels you can execute consistently and turn them into repeatable systems.

CRE channel priorities (in order):
1) **Warm outbound** (fast cash): DM/email/calls to roofers in target cities.
2) **Partnerships** (slow build, high leverage): suppliers, manufacturers, associations.
3) **Paid acquisition** (scale): once funnel and close rate are stable.

Rule: when cash is the constraint, default to **outbound + follow-up** until calendar is full.

## 5) Sales conversion principles for this offer
Hormozi doesn’t replace selling. It makes selling easier.

The call has to do 3 things:
1) Make the problem specific and expensive.
2) Make the mechanism believable.
3) Make the risk feel capped.

CRE angle:
- They don’t want “marketing.” They want jobs.
- The mechanism is speed-to-lead + qualification + booking.
- The risk reversal is the 14-day pilot guarantee.

## 6) The 3 templates we use daily
### A) One-sentence offer
“We install a managed system that books qualified commercial roofing estimates directly onto your calendar, and you only pay the full setup if we prove it works in the first 14 days.”

### B) Guarantee line
“If we don’t book 3 qualified commercial estimates in 14 days, you don’t pay the $8k setup. You just cover ad spend.”

### C) ‘Why us’ mechanism line
“Speed-to-lead and follow-up is the whole game. We run the ads, respond immediately, qualify, and lock in a calendar invite. You just show up and close.”

## 7) What I’ll optimize next (when you ask)
If you tell me the bottleneck (leads vs booking rate vs show rate vs close rate), I’ll:
- rewrite the offer positioning,
- adjust the guarantee structure,
- produce a one-page pitch + objection answers,
- produce the exact follow-up sequences needed to fix that bottleneck.
