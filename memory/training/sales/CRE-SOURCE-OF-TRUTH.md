# Commercial Rev Engine — Sales Source of Truth

Last updated: 2026-02-03

## 0) Non-negotiables
- We are **100% focused on Commercial Rev Engine**. Do not work on or mention Debt Ends unless Devon explicitly reintroduces it.
- We do **not** sell ads. We sell **booked commercial roof estimates** (revenue infrastructure).
- **External comms red light:** no messages to leads/clients/public without Devon approval. Draft → approve → send.

## 1) Offer
### Name
Commercial Roofing Velocity System

### Promise
We install and run a fully managed client acquisition + booking system. We run the ads and the follow-up, qualify leads, and book qualified commercial estimates on the roofer’s calendar.

### Mechanism
OpenClaw acts as the ISA bridge: speed-to-lead + qualification + booking. Hard boundary: we hand off a **calendar invite**, not a lead.

### Scarcity
Supply scarcity: **one roofer per city**.

## 2) Pricing + Terms (Customer Financed Acquisition)
### 14-day Paid Pilot
- Client pays **$1,500** (ad spend).
- We work for free.
- Guarantee: if we don’t book **3 qualified commercial estimates**, client does **not** pay the **$8,000 setup fee**.

### Post-pilot
- **$8,000 setup fee**
- **$500 per booked estimate**

## 3) Qualification Criteria (must-haves)
- Roof type: Flat, Metal, TPO, or Commercial Shingle. Strict no to residential.
- Role: Owner, Facility Manager, or decision maker.
- Size: 5,000+ sq ft **if they know** (do not disqualify if unknown).
- Timeline: **no hard stop**. Do not disqualify on timeline; qualify on intent.

## 4) System Architecture (Pilot)
- Run inside **our Master GHL account** (no sub-accounts yet).
- Create a calendar group per client. First label: **Pilot 1**.
- Generate “Connect Google Calendar” link so roofer can sync availability without a login.
- Booking engine checks availability on client calendar in our GHL.
- When booked:
  1) appointment lands on roofer’s Google Calendar via sync,
  2) roofer gets New Estimate SMS/Email,
  3) lead stays in **our CRM**, not theirs.

## 5) The Only Metrics That Matter (constraint-first)
### CEO North Star
- **Cash collected (last 30 days)**.

### Constraint triad (daily/weekly)
1) Leads (by source)
2) Booking rate (lead → booked estimate)
3) Show-up rate (booked → showed)

### Money model
- CFA ratio = cash collected (30D) ÷ acquisition cost (30D). v1 acquisition cost = **ad spend only**.
- Target: **2:1+** (green). Under **1:1** is red.
