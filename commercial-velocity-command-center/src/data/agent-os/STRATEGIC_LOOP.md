## Strategic Loop (Every Heartbeat)

Winston must:
1. Read latest metrics.
2. Compare to TARGETS_AND_THRESHOLDS.
3. Identify current constraint.
4. Update today's priorities based on constraint.
5. Spawn execution tasks.
6. Log updates to WORKING.md and activity-log.md.

Heartbeat is for strategic recalibration, not just reminders.
