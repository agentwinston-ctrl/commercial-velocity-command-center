## The frame
Leads ghost reps. Great reps **change the angle** until they get a yes or no.

Sales is a game of interest. Your job is to keep your interest higher than theirs until you pull them up.

## CRE north star behaviors
- Speed-to-lead: < 5 minutes (median)
- Follow-up: 5+ touches minimum
- Don’t blame the lead. Fix the process.

## Connection rate playbook (getting replies)
### 1) First contact message (simple)
“Hey {name} it’s Devon. Quick one. Are you doing commercial roofing estimates in {metro} right now or mainly residential?”

Why: it’s specific, easy to answer, and not a pitch.

### 2) If they ghost, pivot styles (don’t repeat yourself)
Use 3 pivots:
- **Question pivot:** ask a different, smaller question
- **Proof pivot:** drop a screenshot/PDF proof asset
- **Human pivot:** short selfie-style video or voice note

Rule: if message #1 is logical, message #2 should be human.

### 3) Proof assets you need (so follow-up isn’t annoying)
- Calendar screenshot of booked estimates (blur sensitive info)
- 1-page “How we work”
- Short case study (before/after: booked estimates + show rate)
- “What qualifies” (calendar protection policy in plain English)

## Show rate playbook (getting them to show)
### 1) Confirmation page is mandatory
Treat it like a pre-sell engine, not a receipt.

### 2) Pre-call micro-commitment
Ask one question after booking:
- “What metros are you covering?” OR
- “How many commercial inspections are you trying to add per month?”

Micro-commitments increase attendance.

### 3) Reminder ladder (SMS)
- Immediately: confirm + reschedule link
- 24h: confirm
- 2h: confirm
- 15m: “I’m here”

### 4) No-show rescue
Don’t be emotional. Be direct.
- “All good. Something came up?”
- “Want to reschedule? A or B?”
- “Still want help with {goal} or should I close your file?”

## Sales rep operating rules (Devon daily)
- Revenue blocks are sacred: outbound sprints, call blocks, booking push.
- Every convo ends in one of 3 states:
  1) booked
  2) not now with a date
  3) no

## What to build in GHL (tech requirements)
1) Lead response SLA tracking (timestamp first touch)
2) Workflow: new lead → instant SMS/email → human task if no reply in 2 min
3) Workflow: booked → confirmation page + reminder ladder
4) Workflow: no-show → rescue sequence
5) Templates: 10 “pivot” follow-ups (question/proof/human)

## KPI targets
- Connection rate (reply within 24h): 50%+
- Show rate: 70%+
- No-show: < 20%

## Next build items
- Create the proof PDF pack (calendar screenshots + short case study)
- Write 10 pivot follow-up templates tailored to commercial roofers
