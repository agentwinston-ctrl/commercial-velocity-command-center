# Leads OS (100M Leads) — CRE

## Rule of 100
When lead flow is low, check volume first. 100 reach-outs/day.

## Core Four (CRE focus)
- Cold Outreach (DMs)
- Paid Ads (Leakage Audit)

## CRE Flagship Acquisition Asset
### Revenue Leakage Audit
We sell the diagnosis: missed calls = lost revenue.
We do not sell ads. We sell the math + fix.

## Daily Output Targets (defaults)
- 100 DMs/day
- 10 meaningful conversations/day
- 2 booked sales calls/day
